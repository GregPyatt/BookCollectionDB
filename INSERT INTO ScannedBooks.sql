'History, literature, religion, myth, film, psychology, theory, and daily conversation all rely heavily on narrative. Cutting across many disciplines, 
narratology describes and analyzes the language of narrative with its regularly recurring patterns, deeply established conventions for transmission, 
and interpretive codes, whether in novels, cartoons, or case studies. Ã¸ Indispensable to writers, critics, and scholars in many fields, 
A Dictionary of Narratology provides quick and reliable access to terms and concepts that are defined, illustrated, and cross-referenced. 
All entries are keyed to articles or books in which the terms originated or are exemplified. This revised edition contains additional entries and updates some existing ones.',
