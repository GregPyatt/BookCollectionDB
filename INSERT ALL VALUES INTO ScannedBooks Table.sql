('Prince''s Sign O'' the Times', 'Michaelangelo Matos', 'Social Science', '2004-03-31', 'A&C Black', 121, '9780826415479', 'FALSE', 'One of the greatest double albums of the vinyl era, Sign ''O'' the Times shows Prince at his peak. Here, Michaelangelo Matos tells the story of how it emerged from an extraordinary period of creativity to become one of the landmark recordings of the 1980s. He also illustrates beautifully how - if a record is great enough and lucky enough to hit you at the right time - it can change your way of looking at the world. EXCERPT The most immediately striking thing about Sign ''O'' the Times is the jazzy sensibility running through it. Prince''s father was a jazz musician, his mother a vocalist; he''d been a fan of chops-heavy jazz-fusion as well as rock and R&B growing up. But when Prince began recording for Warner Bros., he abjured the brass sections that dominated groups like Earth, Wind & Fire and Parliament-Funkadelic, opting instead for stacked synthesizer patterns and a spare, cold feel that markedly contrasted with lush, overarranged disco and the wild, thick underbrush of the era''s giant funk ensembles; Rickey Vincent, author of Funk: The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One, dubbed it "naked funk." Getting away from traditional R&B instrumentation is an underappreciated aspect of Prince''s crossover success; Prince is also said to have actively disliked the sound of horns early in his career.'),

In 1988, Jarkko Oikarinen wrote the original IRC program at the University of Oulu, Finland. As he says in his foreword, "IRC started as one summer trainee''s programming exercise. A hack grew into a software development project that hundreds of people participated in, and then became a worldwide environment where tens of thousands of people now spend time with each other. I have found many of my friends through IRC and learnt a significant part of my present software engineering knowledge while using and working with IRC. That would not have been possible without learning from code examples and hacks from others". IRC has continued to grow in popularity since its inception. Millions of people from all over the world now use IRC to chat with friends, discuss projects and collaborate on research. With a simple, clearly defined protocol, IRC has become one of the most accessible chat environments, with clients written for a multitude of operating systems. And IRC is more than just a simple chat system it is a network of intercommunicating servers, allowing thousands of clients to connect from anywhere in the world using the IRC protocol. While IRC is easy to get into and many people are happy to use it without being aware of what''s happening under the hood, there are those who hunger for more knowledge, and this book is for them. IRC Hacks is a collection of tips and tools that cover just about everything needed to become a true IRC master, featuring contributions from some of the most renowned IRC hackers, many of whom collaborated on IRC, grouping together to form the channel #irchacks on the freenode IRC network (irc.freenode.net). Like all of our Hacks books, there are many different ways to use IRC Hacks. You can read the book from cover to cover, but you might be better served by picking an interesting item from the table of contents and just diving in. If you''re relatively new to IRC, you should considering starting with a few hacks from each progressive chapter. Chapter 1 starts you off by showing you how to connect to IRC, while Chapter 2 acquaints you with the everyday concepts you''ll need to use IRC effectively. Chapter 3 is all about users and channels, and introduces the first pieces of code. Chapter 4 shows you how to make useful enhancements to IRC clients. Chapter 5 is where you will learn the basics about creating IRC bots, with Chapters 6-12 introducing more complex bots that can be used for logging, servicing communities, searching, announcing, networking, managing channels or simply for having fun. Chapter 13 delves into the IRC protocol in more detail, and Chapter 14 demonstrates some interesting alternative methods for connecting to IRC. Finally, Chapter 15 will move you on to new pastures by showing you how to set up your own IRC server. This book presents an opportunity to learn how IRC works and how to make best use of some of the features that have made it the most successful, most scalable, and most mature chat system on this planet.

This book will present the basics of probability in a non-rigorous manner. Only an understanding of arithmetic and some basic algebra are necessary to learn these ideas. No high-powered mathematical notation or formal proofs will be used, rather the concepts will be developed from examples using coins, dice, cards, and other common probability devices.'),

('A History of the End of the World', 'Jonathan Kirsch', 'History', '2007-09-18', 'HarperOne', 352, '9780061349874', 'FALSE', '"[The Book of] Revelation has served as a "language arsenal" in a great many of the social, cultural, and political conflicts in Western history. Again and again, Revelation has stirred some dangerous men and women to act out their own private apocalypses. Above all, the moral calculus of Revelation—the demonization of one''s enemies, the sanctification of revenge taking, and the notion that history must end in catastrophe—can be detected in some of the worst atrocities and excesses of every age, including our own. For all of these reasons, the rest of us ignore the book of Revelation only at our impoverishment and, more to the point, at our own peril." The mysterious author of the Book of Revelation (or the Apocalypse, as the last book of the New Testament is also known) never considered that his sermon on the impending end times would last beyond his own life. In fact, he predicted that the destruction of the earth would be witnessed by his contemporaries. Yet Revelation not only outlived its creator; this vivid and violent revenge fantasy has played a significant role in the march of Western civilization. Ever since Revelation was first preached as the revealed word of Jesus Christ, it has haunted and inspired hearers and readers alike. The mark of the beast, the Antichrist, 666, the Whore of Babylon, Armageddon, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are just a few of the images, phrases, and codes that have burned their way into the fabric of our culture. The questions raised go straight to the heart of the human fear of death and obsession with the afterlife. Will we, individually or collectively, ride off to glory, or will we drown in hellfire for all eternity? As those who best manipulate this dark vision learned, which side we fall on is often a matter of life or death. Honed into a weapon in the ongoing culture wars between states, religions, and citizenry, Revelation has significantly altered the course of history. Kirsch, whom the Washington Post calls "a fine storyteller with a flair for rendering ancient tales relevant and appealing to modern audiences," delivers a far-ranging, entertaining, and shocking history of this scandalous book, which was nearly cut from the New Testament. From the fall of the Roman Empire to the Black Death, the Inquisition to the Protestant Reformation, the New World to the rise of the Religious Right, this chronicle of the use and abuse of the Book of Revelation tells the tale of the unfolding of history and the hopes, fears, dreams, and nightmares of all humanity.'),

By introducing generic concepts directly into the Common Language Runtime (CLR), Microsoft has also created the first language–independent generics implementation. The result is a solution that allows generic types to be leveraged by all the languages of the .NET platform. This book explores all aspects of the .NET generics implementation, covering everything from fundamental generic concepts, to the elements of generic syntax, to a broader view of how and when you might apply generics. It digs into the details associated with creating and consuming your own generic classes, structures, methods, delegates, and interfaces, examining all the nuances associated with leveraging each of these language constructs. The book also looks at guidelines for working with generic types, the performance gains achieved with generics, the new generic container libraries (BCL and third party), and key aspects of the underlying .NET implementation. For those transitioning from C++, the book provides an in–depth look at the similarities and differences between templates and.NET generics.

And once you lose that weight, you''re going to keep it off. Forever. That''s because Eat This, Not That! is a tool. It''s designed to make smart food choices easier, no matter where you''re making them. Consider just a handful of real stories from real people who''ve shed 25, 50, 75 pounds—or more!—and you''ll understand why Eat This, Not That! is "The no-diet weight-loss solution": • Michael Colombo of Staten Island, New York, shed 91 pounds in just over 8 months and conquered life-threatening sleep apnea, after picking up a copy of Eat This, Not That!. "My confidence has sky-rocketed!" he says. • Erika Bowen of Minneapolis, Minnesota, dropped 84 pounds—without dieting. "I feel like I''ve always wanted to feel," Bowen reports. Once she discovered the truth about her food, she learned she could lose weight and never feel hungry. • Dana Bickelman of Waltham, Massachusetts, lost 70 pounds after discovering the shocking truth about the foods she was eating.

Now, with a new Introduction and Afterword for 2010, The Little Book that Still Beats the Market updates and expands upon the research findings from the original book. Included are data and analysis covering the recent financial crisis and model performance through the end of 2009. In a straightforward and accessible style, the book explores the basic principles of successful stock market investing and then reveals the author’s time-tested formula that makes buying above average companies at below average prices automatic. Though the formula has been extensively tested and is a breakthrough in the academic and professional world, Greenblatt explains it using 6th grade math, plain language and humor. He shows how to use his method to beat both the market and professional managers by a wide margin. You’ll also learn why success eludes almost all individual and professional investors, and why the formula will continue to work even after everyone “knows” it.

Here is a seminal work on the philosophy of successful leadership that is as applicable to contemporary business as it is to war. Today many leading American business schools use the text as required reading for aspiring managers, and even Oliver Stone''s award-winning film Wall Street cites The Art of War as a guide to those who strive for success. Now acclaimed novelist James Clavell, for whom Sun Tzu''s writing has been an inspiration, gives us a newly edited Art of War.

('Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language', 'Robin Dunbar', 'Language Arts & Disciplines', '1998-01-01', 'Harvard University Press', 230, '9780674363366', 'FALSE', 'What a big brain we have for all the small talk we make. It''s an evolutionary riddle that at long last makes sense in this intriguing book about what gossip has done for our talkative species. Psychologist Robin Dunbar looks at gossip as an instrument of social order and cohesion--much like the endless grooming with which our primate cousins tend to their social relationships. Apes and monkeys, humanity''s closest kin, differ from other animals in the intensity of these relationships. All their grooming is not so much about hygiene as it is about cementing bonds, making friends, and influencing fellow primates. But for early humans, grooming as a way to social success posed a problem: given their large social groups of 150 or so, our earliest ancestors would have had to spend almost half their time grooming one another--an impossible burden. What Dunbar suggests--and his research, whether in the realm of primatology or in that of gossip, confirms--is that humans developed language to serve the same purpose, but far more efficiently. It seems there is nothing idle about chatter, which holds together a diverse, dynamic group--whether of hunter-gatherers, soldiers, or workmates. Anthropologists have long assumed that language developed in relationships among males during activities such as hunting. Dunbar''s original and extremely interesting studies suggest otherwise: that language in fact evolved in response to our need to keep up to date with friends and family. We needed conversation to stay in touch, and we still need it in ways that will not be satisfied by teleconferencing, email, or any other communication technology. As Dunbar shows, the impersonal world of cyberspace will not fulfill our primordial need for face-to-face contact. From the nit-picking of chimpanzees to our chats at coffee break, from neuroscience to paleoanthropology, Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language offers a provocative view of what makes us human, what holds us together, and what sets us apart.'),

Components are the fundamental building blocks of .NET applications; they can both simplify and add flexibility to complex applications. Applied properly, component-oriented programming enable reuse, allow for long-term maintenance, application extensibility and scalability. Component technology is nothing new, but the .NET Framework offers developers a new way to develop binary components rapidly, without the hurdles that many COM developers have had to deal with prior to .NET. While retaining all of the core concepts that define component-oriented development--language independence, separation of interface from implementation, binary compatibility, versioning, concurrency management, location transparency, security, deployment--.NET is built upon a fresh component-oriented runtime that has an easier time providing these core concepts. Programming .NET Componentsoffers a complete introduction to the new Microsoft .NET component model, focusing on the aspects of .NET that make it ideal for building reusable, maintainable, and robust components. Author Juval L��������wy, a noted authority on component-oriented programming, teaches the intricacies of .NET component programming and the related system issues to application developers, along with relevant design guidelines, tips, best practices, and known pitfalls.

Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today''s top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader''s viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriate All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader''s understanding of these enduring works. Largely ignored when it was first published in 1848, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels''s The Communist Manifesto has become one of the most widely read and discussed social and political testaments ever written. Its ideas and concepts have not only become part of the intellectual landscape of Western civilization: They form the basis for a movement that has, for better or worse, radically changed the world. Addressed to the common worker, the Manifesto argues that history is a record of class struggle between the bourgeoisie, or owners, and the proletariat, or workers. In order to succeed, the bourgeoisie must constantly build larger cities, promote new products, and secure cheaper commodities, while eliminating large numbers of workers in order to increase profits without increasing production—a scenario that is perhaps even more prevalent today than in 1848. Calling upon the workers of the world to unite, the Manifesto announces a plan for overthrowing the bourgeoisie and empowering the proletariat. This volume also includes Marx''s The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852), one of the most brilliant works ever written on the philosophy of history, and Theses on Feuerbach (1845), Marx''s personal notes about new forms of social relations and education. Communist Manifesto translated by Samuel Moore, revised and edited by Friedrich Engels.

The volume includes Sartre''s 1945 lecture “Existentialism Is a Humanism” and his analysis of Camus''s The Stranger, along with a discussion of these works by acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal. This edition is a translation of the 1996 French edition, which includes Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre''s introduction and a Q&A with Sartre about his lecture. In her foreword, intended for an American audience, acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal offers an assessment of both works. It was to correct common misconceptions about his thought that Sartre accepted an invitation to speak on October 29, 1945, at the Club Maintenant in Paris. The unstated objective of his lecture (“Existentialism Is a Humanism”) was to expound his philosophy as a form of “existentialism,” a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity. The idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartre''s doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to begin with. He creates his essence—his self, his being—through the choices he freely makes (“existence precedes essence”). Were it not for the contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing, therefore, we commit not only ourselves but all of mankind.'),

LINQ is one of the most exciting and powerful development technologies Microsoft has introduced in many years. In this book, two Microsoft insiders share their intimate understanding of LINQ, revealing new patterns and best practices for making the most of it. Charlie Calvert and Dinesh Kulkarni clearly explain how LINQ resolves the long-time ''impedance mismatch'' between the object-oriented code programmers write and the relational databases they need to access. Next, they show how LINQ integrates querying into C# as a ''first class citizen.'' Using realistic code examples, they show how LINQ gives developers a stronglytyped, IntelliSense-aware technology they can use to work with data no matter where it is - in SQL databases, XML files, or in generic data structures such as Lists and Queues. Readers will learn how to extend LINQ to reach virtually any alternative data source. Drawing on their experience as members of Microsoft''s LINQ and C# teams, Calvert and Kulkarni carefully explain the three concepts at LINQ''s core: LINQ as transformative, composable, and declarative. By fully explaining the full meaning and importance of these concepts, the authors liberate developers to exploit LINQ''s full power as never before. While this book focuses on LINQ development with C#, a full chapter on LINQ and Visual Basic makes this book even more widely accessible and useful.'),

That''s where Developing ASP Components comes in. The first section of the book explores the following topics, which you need to understand to develop components for ASP effectively: - The configuration of your ASP development environment. - ASP components and the Component Object Model (COM). - ASP components and threading models. - ASP components and the Microsoft Transaction Server, which can be used to provide a variety of services to ASP components. - The objects, properties, methods, and events available in the ASP object model. Because more and more developers find themselves using more than a single language tool, the remaining three sections of the book focus on ASP component development using any of the three major development tools: Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual C++ and the ActiveX Template Library (AU), and Microsoft J++. Each section carefully focuses on the issues that concern the ASP component developer using that particular development environment. These include: - Accessing ASP''s intrinsic objects. - Accessing data using either OLE DB (in the case of C++) or ADO (in the case of VB and J++). - Creating n-tier web applications with VB. - Handling persistence using MFC along with Visual C++/ATL. - Accessing native code (the Windows libraries, which are written in C) from J++. Thorough coverage of the background information needed to develop ASP components, and a focus on component development in each of three major development environments, makes Developing ASP Components the definitive resource for ASP application and component developers.'),

Porter''s Competitive Advantage explores the underpinnings of competitive advantage in the individual firm. Competitive Advantage introduces a whole new way of understanding what a firm does. Porter''s groundbreaking concept of the value chain disaggregates a company into "activities," or the discrete functions or processes that represent the elemental building blocks of competitive advantage. Now an essential part of international business thinking, Competitive Advantage takes strategy from broad vision to an internally consistent configuration of activities. Its powerful framework provides the tools to understand the drivers of cost and a company''s relative cost position. Porter''s value chain enables managers to isolate the underlying sources of buyer value that will command a premium price, and the reasons why one product or service substitutes for another. He shows how competitive advantage lies not only in activities themselves but in the way activities relate to each other, to supplier activities, and to customer activities. Competitive Advantage also provides for the first time the tools to strategically segment an industry and rigorously assess the competitive logic of diversification. That the phrases "competitive advantage" and "sustainable competitive advantage" have become commonplace is testimony to the power of Porter''s ideas. Competitive Advantage has guided countless companies, business school students, and scholars in understanding the roots of competition. Porter''s work captures the extraordinary complexity of competition in a way that makes strategy both concrete and actionable.'),

ADSI is the set of interfaces you need to access any and all kinds of directory, and this book will show you how to use it to prepare your applications for the twenty first century. In this book, we start by looking at what ADSI is, and discuss the range of tasks it can be used for. We move on to discussing how to build ADSI clients to read and manipulate directory data, looking in particular at the Windows 2000 Active Directory, which makes network resources and information transparently and programmatically available to you. We also look at Exchange and IIS directories. When then take an in-depth look at searching directories and the security issues they raise. Once we''ve looked at what you can do from the client, we discuss using LDAP, ADSI''s parent technology, and look at writing your own directory providers for ADSI clients.

Yet while such figures are inspiring and admirable, Harvard Business School Professor Joseph Badaracco argues that their larger-than-life accomplishments are simply not what makes the world work. What does, he says, is the sum of millions of small yet consequential decisions that men and women working far from the limelight make every day: how a line worker for a pharmaceutical company responds when he discovers a defect in a product''s safety seal; how a manager deals with a valued employee suspected of stealing; how a trader handles a transaction error that will cost a client money. Badaracco calls them "quiet leaders"-people who choose responsible, behind-the-scenes action over public heroism to resolve tough leadership challenges. These individuals don''t fit the stereotype of the bold and gutsy leader, and they don''t want to. What they want is to do the "right thing" for their organizations, their coworkers, and themselves-but inconspicuously and without casualties. They do so by being baldly realistic about the complexities of their own motives and those of the dilemmas they face. In today''s fast and fluid business world, nothing is as it seems. And they know it. Drawing from a four-year study of quiet leadership, Badaracco presents eight practical and counterintuitive guidelines for confronting situations in which right and wrong seem like moving targets. Grounding each strategy in an engaging story, he shows how these "non-heroes" succeed by managing their political capital, buying themselves time, bending the rules, and more. From leaders in the executive suite to aspiring leaders in the office cubicle,Leading Quietlycompellingly shows how patient, everyday efforts can add up to a better company and even a better world. Joseph L. Badaracco Jr.is a Professor at Harvard Business School, the Chair of the M.B.A. Elective Curriculum, and the author ofDefining Moments: When Managers Must Choose between Right and Right(ISBN 0875848036, HBS Press, 1997).'),

Gulp is a build system that lets developers run a multitude of file transforming processes with a single click. And with so many libraries working together, a dependency manager such as Bower can keep track of versions, notify of conflicts, and in some cases even fix them. Finally, a scaffolding tool like Yeoman lets developers create applications and modules with just a single command. These tools allow for an efficient workflow that speeds up the time it takes to get applications running and deployed. Front-End Tooling with Gulp, Bower, and Yeoman shows how to use and combine these popular tools to set up a customized development workflow from start to finish. Starting with the big picture of the development process, it explains how these tools mesh together, and using patterns and examples, it teaches how to use each tool. The second half of the book dives deeper and explains how to integrate and extend these tools even more in the development process. By the end of this book, readers will be skilled at using Gulp, Bower, and Yeoman and combining them to create a powerful, tailored workflow for themselves and their teams. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.')
